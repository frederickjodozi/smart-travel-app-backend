## *smart-travel-app-backend: TripleTen graduation personal project!*
This project consists of *my first self-directed FullStack application*! It is a personal demonstration of all the skills I have learned from the TripleTen curriculum. I was very excited building it!

The App consists of a Main page featuring a Searchbar that returns information about sightseeing locations from all over the world upon query. It will be possible for users to make a profile and save their favorite locations in an alternate page.

Both this part and the Frontend are hosted together on a Cloud and helped me solidify my knowledge and skills hosting applications on cloud servers.

## *Features*
The main Features on the Backend are as follows:
- An **Index Route** splitting requests between users and location cards endpoints.
- **Controllers** for both user and location card request using **find**, **create**, **update** and **delete** query methods.
- **Middlewares** for **user authorization**, **request logging** and **validation** and a **centralized error handler**.
- User and location card **models** using **Mongoose Schemas**.

## *Contributions*
This project can be cloned on a local machine for studying and/or editing, and relevant pull requests will be accepted!

I would first like to thank TripleTen for teaching me the skills required to build this project, and also OpenTripMap API for their amazing and free-to-use database of sightseeing locations: https://dev.opentripmap.org/product

Stay tuned for updates :)
